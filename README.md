## 🚀 Introducing NOVA

**NOVA Labs** is proud to introduce **NOVA**, a groundbreaking leap in Artificial Intelligence. Unlike traditional chatbots that process text as data points, NOVA is designed to understand the *human* behind the screen.

NOVA is a **Multimodal Emotional Intelligence System** capable of perceiving the world as you do. It listens to the tone of your voice, observes your facial expressions, and analyzes the nuances of your words to provide deeply empathetic, context-aware support.

Whether you need a listener for your daily struggles, a companion to share your joys, or a psychological mirror to help you understand your own emotional state, NOVA is here.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **👁️ Multimodal Perception**: NOVA sees you via camera (facial emotion recognition), hears you via microphone (vocal tone analysis), and reads your texts to form a complete picture of your mood.
*   **🧠 Psychological Analysis Engine (SLM)**: Beyond simple chat, NOVA includes a specialized Small Language Model (SLM) layer that can generate comprehensive **Psychological Assessment Reports**, offering insights into your stress levels, emotional profile, and suggested interventions.
*   **💾 Living Memory**: NOVA remembers your past conversations, allowing for a continuous, evolving relationship rather than isolated interactions.
*   **🎨 Adaptive Interface**: A beautiful, responsive UI that adapts to the conversation, providing a calming and futuristic user experience.
*   **🔒 Privacy First**: Your sessions are stored locally on your device, ensuring your emotional data remains yours.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

NOVA is built upon a robust, modern architecture designed for speed, scalability, and intelligence.

### **Frontend ( The Face of NOVA )**
*   **React 19 & Vite**: For a lightning-fast, reactive user interface.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, modern, and responsive styling.
*   **Recharts**: To visualize complex emotional data into understandable graphs.
*   **Lucide React**: For clean, intuitive iconography.
*   **TypeScript**: Ensuring code safety and reliability across the application.

### **Backend ( The Brain of NOVA )**
*   **Python FastAPI**: A high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.10+.
*   **Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct** — NOVA's conversational brain, with two interchangeable providers:
    *   *Local*: Unsloth GGUF weights served by **Ollama** (100% private, free, offline)
    *   *Cloud*: **Groq API** serving the same weights (used on Render deploys)
*   **Pretrained Emotion Models (Hugging Face)**: DistilRoBERTa (text), ViT-FER2013 (facial expression), wav2vec2 (voice tone) — fused into a single emotional context vector.
*   **Uvicorn**: An ASGI web server implementation for running the Python backend.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

Get NOVA running on your local machine in minutes.

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
*   **Python** (v3.10+)
*   **Git**
*   **Ollama** (Get it [here](https://ollama.com/download)) — serves the local LLM
*   *Optional*: Google Gemini API Key — only used as a cloud fallback if the local backend is unreachable

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/NOVA.git
    cd NOVA
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    We have streamlined the process. You can install everything from the root directory.
    *   *Frontend*: `cd client && npm install`
    *   *Backend*: `cd server && pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Environment Configuration**
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_optional_api_key_here
```
    *Note: NOVA is fully functional without any API key — everything (chat, emotions, reports) runs locally. The Gemini key only enables the cloud fallback if the local backend is down.*

4.  **Set Up the Local LLM (one-time)**
    Download the Unsloth model weights and import them into Ollama:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p server/models
    curl -L -o server/models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf \
      "https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf"
    cd server/models
    ollama create nova-llama3.2-3b -f Modelfile
    ```
    Then make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`).

5.  **Launch NOVA**
    From the **root** directory of the project, simply run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command utilizes `concurrently` to launch both the Python Backend and the React Frontend simultaneously.

6.  **Access the Interface**
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    *   **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173`
    *   *(Backend API runs at `http://localhost:8000`)*

## 🎮 How to Use

1.  **Start a Chat**: Click "Start New Conversation" on the landing page.
2.  **Express Yourself**: Type text, click the **Microphone** to speak, or click the **Camera** to analyze your facial expression.
3.  **Receive Empathy**: NOVA will respond in real-time, adjusting its tone based on your inputs.
4.  **Generate Report**: After a conversation, click the **"Generate Report"** button in the header. NOVA's SLM will digest the session and present a detailed analysis of your mental well-being.

## ☁️ Deploying to Render

The repo includes a [render.yaml](render.yaml) Blueprint, so deployment is one click:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render: **New → Blueprint** and select the repo. Both services are created automatically.
3. Set the environment variables when prompted:
   *   `nova-backend` → `GROQ_API_KEY` (get a free key at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys))
   *   `nova-frontend` → `VITE_API_URL` (your backend URL, e.g. `https://nova-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`)
4. Redeploy the frontend after setting `VITE_API_URL`.

**Deploy architecture:** on Render the backend chats via the free Groq API (hosted Llama) instead of the local Ollama model, which can't fit in cloud RAM. The default Blueprint runs on the free plan (512MB) with the HF emotion models disabled — chat, safety layer and reports all work; text/face/voice emotion analysis degrades to a neutral baseline. To enable all 3 emotion modalities, set the `ENABLE_*_EMOTION` vars to `"true"` and switch `nova-backend` to `plan: standard` (~2GB RAM; the free plan is too small for torch + the models).

**Local vs Deploy:** local development stays 100% local (Ollama + Unsloth GGUF, no API key). The code auto-detects: it uses Ollama when reachable, otherwise falls back to Groq.
